- 👋 Hi, I’m Amanda Kenes, 22-year-old student with high ambitious, no funds and a great sense of humor
- 👀 I’m interested in development software, web and mobile development and a sprinkle of data science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and practicing HTML, CSS and (especially) JavaScript but I've put a foot or two in the waters of React, PHP, C, Ruby and Phyton.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects to improve my already existent skills and learn new things on the way.
- 📫 You can easily reach me through y LinkedIn profile (https://linkedin.com/in/amandakenes) or through e-mail (amandakeness@outlook.com)
